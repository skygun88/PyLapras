# Face Age & Gender detection tool
Simple opencv & tensorflow solution to estimate Age and Gender in your 
next project. Command line or Python DIY style. 

Based on and forked from: https://github.com/yu4u/age-gender-estimation

Good enough for pet-projects and prototypes, but not ready for production 
real-life applications

## How

```commandline
pip3 install py-agender[cpu]  # for the cpu version of TensorFlow
pip3 install py-agender[gpu]  # for the gpu version of TensorFlow
```

**Warning**: ~190MB download (pretrained network is heavy).  


CLI: 

```commandline
py-agender PATH_TO_IMAGE
```

Python:

```python
from pyagender import PyAgender

agender = PyAgender() 
# see available options in __init__() src

faces = agender.detect_genders_ages(cv2.imread(MY_IMAGE))
# [
#   {left: 34, top: 11, right: 122, bottom: 232, width:(r-l), height: (b-t), gender: 0.67, age: 23.5},
#   ...
# ]

# Additional options & methods in PyAgender source
``` 

Don't forget to download pretrained weights if using source code DIY style.

## TODO: 
- add options (like STDIN input, output formatters etc.) for useful commandline 
applications 
- add help output
- train better network with higher image resolution
- train another (more compact & precise) network architecture

## Tests

```commandline
python3 -m unittest 
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7
- numpy ~> 1.15
- Keras ~> 2.2
- tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu ~> 1.10
- opencv-python ~> 3.4.2+contrib

Tested on:
- MacOS 10.13 high Sierra without GPU (you're welcome to update & contribute!)
